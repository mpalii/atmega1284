#### Example 04 - EXTERNAL PULL-UP resistor is used, R = 20kΩ; R = 20kΩ and C = 1µF is used for debouncing  

**REALTIME:** The start is fine, RC circuit for debounce is fine, ignoring the pull-up resistor leads to the high-impedance state of a button pin, and LEDs start to blink randomly until button will be pushed
